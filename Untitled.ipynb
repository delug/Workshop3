    "As we can see above, the equation for the sigmoid function is $\\sigma (x)=\\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}$. Given a Bernoulli random variable $Y$ with only two classes, e.g., $1$ and $0$, we can write $p(x) = \\mathop{\\mathbb{P}}[Y=1 | X=x]$. So by our model, we assert that $$p(x)=\\sigma (x)=\\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}$$, but we'd like to parameterize this as $$\\frac{1}{1+e^{-(\\beta^Tx + \\beta_{0})}}$$. In order to do so, we need to solve for $(\\beta^Tx + \\beta_{0})$, or if we simplify it as $x'=(\\beta^Tx + \\beta_{0})$, then we only need to solve for $x'$ in $p(x')$.\n",
