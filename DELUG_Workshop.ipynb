A dataset with 100 features could be condensed to 20 meaningful features by dimensionality reduction.

We can reduce the data from 784 dimensions to 2 dimensions using __t-Distributed Neighbor Stochastic Embedding__, or __t-SNE__ for short. t-SNE is an unsupervised, non-linear technique used for data exploration and visualizing high-dimensional data. In short, the way t-SNE works is by calculating a probabilistic similarity measure between instance pairs in both the high dimensionality space and low dimensionality space. It then optimizes these similarity measures using a cost function. Compared to __Principal Components Analysis__ (PCA), a linear dimensionality reduction technique, t-SNE can be used to better visualize nonlinear datasets."

We are primarily concerned with separating our data into a test and train split since we'll be using cross validation later. So what do each of these sets mean? The __training set__ is the sample of data that we fit our model to. Our model _learns_ from this data. The __validation set__ is the sample of data we use to evaluate our model on to fine-tune our __hyperparameters__, which are the parameters of the model that we are able to explicitly change. Hyperparameters are not to be confused with __model parameters__, which are parameters that the ML algorithm will learn on its own, such as weights and biases in a linear regression model or split points in a decision tree. Finally, the __test set__ is the sample of data we wish to test our model on to provide an unbiased evaluation of our model fit on the training data. The model has _never_ seen the test set data before, and an important note is that our test set should be stratified in the same way our training set is set up. It should contain a similar proportion of classes (digits 0 through 9) as our training set. A good rule of thumb is to separate our data into 80% train and 20% test."
