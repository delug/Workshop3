# Data Science Techniques and Algorithms

This workshop will cover some of the most common algorithms for general data science and the best practices that go along with data science as a whole. Specifically, we'll discuss feature engineering, cover a range of important algorithms and techniques such as Cross Validation, Principal Component Analysis, and K-Nearest Neighbors. Emphasis will be placed on the *process* and *pipeline* that one may follow while encountering a new data science project.
